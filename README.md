## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework a visualization dashboard website was developed using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

### Website Details

The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A Comparisons" page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
 * A "Data" page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
   

The website, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries).
